       "This video explores Jupiter and its Great Red Spot. Jupiter is the largest and oldest planet in the solar system, and it’s made of the same elements as a star, though it never grew massive enough to ignite. Its swirling interior of gases and liquids creates the distinctive colorful cloud bands across the planet. The Great Red Spot, an anticyclone, has raged on Jupiter for over a century. As Jupiter is composed of gas and has no land mass, the storm continues with nothing to slow it down. \n",
       "\n",
       "Scientists have observed the Great Red Spot shrinking, darkening, and getting rounder. Initially, they thought this meant the wind speeds within the spot were increasing. However, data now shows that it’s not spinning faster but growing taller. The smaller circumference from above is due to the spot increasing in height. It’s like shaping pottery. As the pottery spins on a wheel, its height increases. From our perspective, the top appears to become smaller and rounder.\n",
       "\n",
       "When it was first observed, the Great Red Spot was large enough to hold three Earths. Currently, the spot is only a little larger than Earth. These discoveries come from analyzing data collected by numerous NASA missions, including Voyager, Hubble, and Juno. Scientists hope further research will unlock more secrets of the Great Red Spot.\n",
